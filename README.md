# Things
3D prints that may be useful to someone but aren't enough of a project to get their own repo.

CadQuery or OpenSCAD are required to render most of them, with `cq_queryabolt` and `nutsnbolts`
libraries available respectively.

Most of these designs are available on [my Printables profile](https://www.printables.com/@mmalecki_221673).
