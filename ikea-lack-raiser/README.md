# Ikea Lack raiser
This is a raiser for an Ikea Lack table. It's meant to go under the legs and
increase their height. Useful if you need more clearance underneath the table,
because, say, you totally forgot to measure the height of the table before
buying a new 3D printer which will totally fit underneath.
